<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a faithful recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game built in Python. Navigate through space, destroy asteroids, and survive as long as possible in this retro-style space shooter.

Here's what makes this game special:

* Classic asteroids gameplay mechanics with modern Python implementation
* Smooth player ship controls for precise navigation
* Accurate asteroid collision detection system
* Responsive shooting mechanics
* Runs at 1280x720 resolution for crisp graphics

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in Python while recreating one of the most beloved arcade games of all time.

![first example of the game in motion](images/example.png)

![second example of the game in motion](images/example2.png)

The game runs at **1280x720 resolution**. Use the following controls:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** | Move the ship |
| **Spacebar** | Shoot |

Navigate through space, avoid asteroids, and shoot them to survive as long as possible!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* [ ] Add a scoring system
* [ ] Implement multiple lives and respawning
* [ ] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids  
* [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement
* [ ] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
* [ ] Add a background image
* [ ] Create different weapon types
* [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
* [ ] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
* [ ] Add a shield power-up
* [ ] Add a speed power-up
* [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped

See the [open issues](https://github.com/username/asteroids/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
